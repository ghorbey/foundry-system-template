## Running builds

This repo includes a `src` directory with all of its actual code, and it compiles that to a `dist` directory that's ignored by the repo's gitignore.

To build the project, you'll need the current LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (or the current release, if preferred) installed. From there, you can build with the following commands in the root of the repo:

```
npm ci
npm run build
```

There are several additional run commands defined in the scripts section of `package.json`, but the build command will run all relevant Vite tasks. If you would prefer to run the compiler constantly and proxy Foundry, you can instead use `npm run serve` to do the same thing and watch for new changes.

Once the repo has been built, you should symlink the contents of the `dist` directory to your Foundry installation's systems directory using the name `[System name]` for the linked directory.
